        <p><i>Hi! I am Srikanth from KL University, B-Tech, CSE course. I have
             selected CSE course of my interest in computers
            So firstly I have got my scholarship of 15% with 42k per year and
             I need to maintain my SCGPA above 9.0 then only 
            the scholarship continues otherwise it stops and I need to pay my
             full course fee without any conscession.
        </i></p>
        <h2 style = "color:red">My CGPA</h2>
        <p><i>I worked hard to get SGPA above 9.0 because firstly I dont know how 
            much hard work gives above 9.0 SGPA so i worked.
            Later, the results come and I got 9.55 SGPA and I am happy with my work
             also I am sad with that because all my well
            known friends got more than my sgpa. Coming to my second semester the
             subject were tough and obviously i thought my 
            sgpa will decrease compare to the first semester but after my exams
             written i calculated it is 9.25 or 9.45 mostly 
            I thought 9.25 and I was sad some what but my results are finally
             come and I got 9.45 and i little bit surprised and 
            finally overal 1st year <b>CGPA is 9.5</b></i>
